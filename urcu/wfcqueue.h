 * Mutual exclusion of cds_wfcq_* / __cds_wfcq_* API

 * Queue read operations "first" and "next", which are used by
 * "for_each" iterations, need to be protected against concurrent
 * "dequeue" and "splice" (for source queue) by the caller.
 * "enqueue", "splice" (for destination queue), and "empty" are the only
 * operations that can be used without any mutual exclusion.
 * Mutual exclusion can be ensured by holding cds_wfcq_dequeue_lock().
 *
 * For convenience, cds_wfcq_dequeue_blocking() and
 * cds_wfcq_splice_blocking() hold the dequeue lock.
 *
 * Besides locking, mutual exclusion of dequeue, splice and iteration
 * can be ensured by performing all of those operations from a single
